### Thse two files are used to extract MFCCs and Mel-spectrogram features from voice commands
### MFCCs is Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)
Cepstrum: The Fourier transform of the logarithm of a speech power spectrum; used to separate vocal tract information from pitch excitation in voiced speech. Mel-frequency Cepstrum is the representation of the power spectrum. The power spectrum is derived by applying a Discrete-Fourier Transform and it describes the intensity or energy of a signal in each frequency bin in the frequency domain. Cepstral is a spectrum-of-a-spectrum. MFCC represents the frequency bands equally in the Mel scale, which mimics the human auditory system, which makes the key audio feature for different audio signal processing tasks.
#### Mel-spectrogram
Mel spectrogram is the combination of Mel-Scale + Spectrogram, Mel scale is the logarithmic transformation of an audio signalâ€™s frequency. The idea behind the Mel scale transformation is that an audio signal with equal distance in the Mel scale is perceived to be equal distance by humans. A spectrogram is a visual representation of the "loudness" or signal strength over time at different frequencies contained in a specific waveform.
